# Simulating-Materials-at-Constant-Pressure-Using-Homogeneous-Coordinates
To run code from equilibrium state for best results:
1) Run code from the using Routine 1; initial lattice structure and Boltzmann distribution for initial veclocity with W=10e6 until thermalisation.
4) Then run simulation again using Routine 2; set lamfin equal to final value of lambda from first run,
